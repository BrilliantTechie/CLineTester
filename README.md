# CCcamTester scripts by Dagger
Scripts for testing that a Cline works or not. Currently in C# and Python
Made to PISS OFF those people that don't share their source code and host testing cline websites and steal them. (You REALLY suck guys)

There is still job to be done.

2- Fix the issue with the socket receive
