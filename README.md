# CCcamTester scripts by Dagger
(Also called Cline, CCcline, CCcam, Camd)

Scripts for testing that a Cline works or not. Currently in Java, C# and Python.

I made them as some people host testing cline websites and reject to share their source code.

If you need more info, here are some links that helped me to do it:
