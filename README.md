# CLine tester scripts
*Also called Cline, CCcline, CCcam and Camd*

Scripts for testing that a Cline works or not. Currently in Java, C# and Python.

I made them as some people host line-testing websites and reject to share their source code.
With those scripts you can program your own testing website/software and be sure that **nobody steals your lines** :)

####Check this repository for a Nline (newcamd) tester: https://github.com/DaggerES/NLineTester

Please, share your code!!!!
